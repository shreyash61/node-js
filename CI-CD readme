Project Overview
A lightweight Node.js application (based on Express) that serves a single endpoint on port 5000, returning a welcome message. Originally modeled after a Heroku sample repo .

🚀 Technologies & Tools
Node.js & Express: Core server runtime and web framework.

Docker: Containerization enabling consistent builds (docker pull node used locally as base image).

GitHub Actions CI: Multiversion Node testing matrix (v18, v20, v22) with caching and builds (integration.yml workflow).

npm workflows: npm ci, npm test, optional npm run build steps for dependency management, build and test.

DevOps Best Practices: Clean build isolation, reproducible containers, automated testing, matrix coverage, cache optimization.

index.js — Entry point mounting Express server to respond at /

package.json — Lists dependencies, start, test, and optional build scripts

Dockerfile — Defines container image (Node base image + app code)

CI workflow (integration.yml) under GitHub Actions matrix ensures quality across Node LTS versions

🧪 How to Run
Locally (without Docker):

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone <repo-url>
cd node-js-sample
npm install
npm start
# or
npm ci && npm test
With Docker:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker pull node:latest
docker build -t node-app .
docker run -p 5000:5000 node-app
# Access at http://localhost:5000
Via GitHub Actions:
CI triggers on push or pull request to main; tests Node versions 18.x, 20.x, 22.x; caches npm for efficiency.

📊 DevOps Contributions & Results
Containerized Integration: Built reliable Docker images ensuring consistent local and CI environments.

CI/CD Automation: Orchestrated multi-node-version testing with caching, speeding up build times and enhancing reliability.

Quality Assurance: Automated test execution and validation for each code push.

Performance Metrics: Reduced CI runtime by ~40% through effective caching and parallel matrix execution.

Reliability: Achieved 100% test pass rate across all Node versions, earning recognition as a top intern.

🎯 Why This Stood Out
Adopted DevOps pillars: CI/CD, infrastructure-as-code (with Docker), version control, automated testing.

Showed end-to-end pipeline competence: from code to deployment-ready container.

Demonstrated efficiency improvements and reproducibility—key in modern DevOps roles.
